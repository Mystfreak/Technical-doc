      <p>Sublime Text is a shareware cross-platform source code editor with a Python application programming interface (API). It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, and functions can be added by users with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.</p>
      <p>What is sublime text good for?<br>
Sublime is one of the most popular code editors out there and for good reason. The program is lightning fast, stable and mature. It also has loads of really useful features and many delightful details. In addition to that, with its modular approach and extendability, Sublime Text can be anything for anyone.</p>
      <p>You can download and install Sublime Text 3 from the <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text Website.</a> Assuming you have access to the right repositories, you can also install Sublime via apt-get on Linux. Help and general documentation is available in the <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/">Sublime Text 3 Docs.</a></p>

    <article>
      <p>There are a lot of amazing and appealing features of the Sublime Text Editor which are really attractive & appealing. It is actually the Best Code Editor Ever in every sense. Let’s explore together what it is offering to all</p>
     <p>GOTO ANYTHING:<br>
Use Goto Anything to open files with only a few keystrokes, and instantly jump to symbols, lines or words.

Triggered with ⌘+P, it is possible to:
<br>
<li>Type part of a file name to open it.</li>
<li>Type @ to jump to symbols, # to search within the file, and : to go to a line number.</li>
       <br>
       These shortcuts can be combined, so <code>tp@rf</code> may take you to a function read_file within a file text_parser.py. Similarly, <code>tp:100</code> would take you to line 100 of the same file.</p>
     <p>GOTO DEFINITION:<br>
Using information from syntax definitions, Sublime Text automatically generates a project-wide index of every class, method and function. <br>This index powers Goto Definition, which is exposed in three different ways:<br>

       <li>A popup is displayed when hovering over a symbol</li>
       <li>Pressing F12 when the caret is on a symbol</li>
       <li>The Goto Symbol in Project functionality</li>
       <br>
Symbol indexing can be customized on a per-syntax basis via configuration files, allowing users to tailor the feature to their needs.</p>
     <li></li>
      <p>MULTIPLE SELECTIONS:<br>
Make ten changes at the same time, not one change ten times. Multiple selections allow you to interactively change many lines at once, rename variables with ease, and manipulate files faster than ever.
<br><br>
Try pressing ⇧+⌘+L to split the selection into lines and ⌘+D to select the next occurrence of the selected word. To make multiple selections with the mouse, take a look at the Column Selection documentation.</p>
      <p>COMMAND PALETTE:<br>
The Command Palette holds infrequently used functionality, like sorting, changing the syntax and changing the indentation settings. With just a few keystrokes, you can search for what you want, without ever having to navigate through the menus or remember obscure key bindings.
<br>
Show the Command Palette with ⇧+⌘+P.</p>
      <p>POWERFUL API AND PACKAGE ECOSYSTEM:<br>
Sublime Text has a powerful, Python API that allows plugins to augment built-in functionality.
<br>
Package Control can be installed via the command palette, providing simple access to thousands of packages built by the community.</p>
      <p>CUSTOMIZE ANYTHING:<br>
Key bindings, menus, snippets, macros, completions and more - just about everything in Sublime Text is customizable with simple JSON files. This system gives you flexibility as settings can be specified on a per-file type and per-project basis.</p>
      <p>SPLIT EDITING:<br>
Get the most out of your wide screen monitor with split editing support. Edit files side by side, or edit two locations in the one file. You can edit with as many rows and columns as you wish. Take advantage of multiple monitors by editing with multiple windows, and using multiple splits in each window.
<br><br>
Take a look at the View ▶ Layout menu for split editing options. To open multiple views into the one file, use the File ▶ New View into File menu item.</p>
      <p>INSTANT PROJECT SWITCH:<br>
Projects in Sublime Text capture the full contents of the workspace, including modified and unsaved files. You can switch between projects in a manner similar to Goto Anything, and the switch is instant, with no save prompts - all your modifications will be restored next time the project is opened.</p>
      <p>PERFORMANCE:<br>
Sublime Text is built from custom components, providing for unmatched responsiveness. From a powerful, custom cross-platform UI toolkit, to an unmatched syntax highlighting engine, Sublime Text sets the bar for performance.</p>
      <p>CROSS PLATFORM:<br>
Sublime Text is available for Mac, Windows and Linux. One license is all you need to use Sublime Text on every computer you own, no matter what operating system it uses.
<br><br>
Sublime Text uses a custom UI toolkit, optimized for speed and beauty, while taking advantage of native functionality on each platform.</p>

     <p>Sublime Text 2 is programmable with Python scripts. Plugins reuse existing commands or create new ones to build a feature. Plugins are rather a logical entity than a physical one.</p>
     <p>Prerequisites:<br>
In order to write plugins, you must be able to program in Python.</p>
     <li>Where to Store Plugins
Sublime Text 2 will look for plugins in these places:
<br>
Packages
       <code>Packages/<pkg_name>/</code>
<br>
Consequently, any plugin nested deeper in Packages won’t be loaded.
<br>
Keeping plugins right under Packages is discouraged, because Sublime Text sorts packages in a predefined way before loading them. Thus, you might get confusing results if your plugins live outside of a package.</li>

     <p>Settings are accessed via the Preferences ▶ Settings menu item. The left-hand pane contains all of the default settings, along with a description of each. The right-hand pane is where customization can be saved.</p>
     <p>CATEGORIES:<br>
The settings in Sublime Text are organized into three categories. The default settings file organizes the settings into sections for easier distinction.
<br><br>
Editor Settings: These settings affect the behavior and functionality presented when editing text in a file. Examples include the font_face, tab_size and spell_check. These settings are presented in the first section of the default settings file.
<br>
User Interface Settings: These settings affect the general user interface, across all open windows. Examples include the theme, animation_enabled and overlay_scroll_bars. These settings are presented in the second section of the default settings file.<br>
Application Behavior Settings: These settings affect the behavior of the application, across all open windows. Examples include the hot_exit, index_files and ignored_packages. These settings are presented in the third section of the default settings file.<br><br>
The User Interface Settings and Application Behavior Settings are global to the entire application and can not be controlled by a syntax specific settings file, nor the settings key in a .sublime-project.</p>
